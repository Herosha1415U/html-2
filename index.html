    <h1>20 facts about Space</h1>
    <p><i>Space is vast, and filled with weird and wonderful things. Some of the bizarre inhabitants and phenomena
                of our
                Universe are more astounding than even the most extreme sci-fi or space movie.
                This selection of some of the most mind-boggling facts about our cosmos takes a bite-sized look at our
                intriguing planet, Moon, Solar System, Galaxy and Universe.</i></p>

            <h3 id="1">(Fact no:1)The Moon is lemon-shaped</h3>
            <p> <b>
                    Despite its appearance in the night sky, our natural satellite is nowhere near round. In fact, the
                    Moon is
                    shaped like a lemon, with flattened poles and bulges on both the near and far side around its
                    equator.
                    This strange shape is thought to have been created during interactions with Earth soon after its
                    formation.</b></p>
                <hr>
            <h3 id="2">(Fact no:2)Milky Way smells of rum, raspberries and booze</h3>
            <p><mark>
                    In 2009, astronomers exploring a giant cloud of gas and dust at the centre of the Milky Way made a
                    surprise
                    discovery – the cloud was packed full of a chemical known as ethyl formate, which has a couple of
                    intriguing
                    properties: it is responsible for giving raspberries their flavour, and has the smell of rum.
                    Another nearby
                    region is also notable as it’s full of ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, the type we use to make
                    alcoholic beverages.It contains enough alcohol to supply every person on the planet with 300,000
                    pints of beer
                    per day for the next
                    billion years! If bottled at the source, the proof for this beer would be very low, with an alcohol
                    content of
                    less than one
                    per cent, but as the cloud also contains plenty of other nasty chemicals, among them carbon monoxide
                    and
                    hydrogen cyanide, it would still leave you with quite a headache the next morning.</mark></p>

            <h3 id="3">(Fact no:3)On Mercury a day is twice as long as a year</h3>
            <p><u>
                    Technically, one Mercurian day lasts 59 Earth days, while a year lasts 88.However, due to Mercury’s
                    very
                    eccentric orbit and alignment with the Sun, the length of time from sunrise to sunrise, known as a
                    ‘solar day’,
                    is equal to 176 Earth days — twice as long as a Mercurian year.</u></p>
                    <hr>
            <h3 id="4">(Fact no:4)You could survive for a couple of minutes in a leaky spacesuit</h3>
            <p><ins>
                    Although films such as Total Recall show instant explosions and rapidly puffed-up spacesuits, the
                    effects of
                    being exposed to space are slightly less dramatic.Although it would definitely be unpleasant, you
                    could survive
                    for a couple of minutes.After around 10 seconds, you would lose consciousness. The lower pressure of
                    the vacuum
                    would cause your blood to boil, along with other body fluids (the moisture on your tongue, for
                    example) – but
                    this boiling alone would not be fatal due to the pressure maintained by our blood vessels
                    themselves.Gas bubbles
                    would form in yourbodily fluids, causing your body to swell up and bloat. The low humidity of space
                    would cause
                    you to cool down rapidly, and your eyes may freeze over.Within one to two minutes, the lack ofoxygen
                    would be
                    deadly.The stress of the situation may make these symptoms worse – you would becomeoxygen-deprived
                    more
                    quickly.A rapid decompression would cause damage to your lungs, eardrums and sinuses,alongwith
                    bruising and
                    bleedingfrom soft tissues.</ins></p>

            <h3 id="5">(Fact no:5)1 tsp of neutron star weighs the same as the human population</h3>
            <p><del>
                    A neutron star’s density is mind-boggling. These stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons
                    packed together
                    in a tiny radius.Just a teaspoonful of this material would weigh over a trillion kilograms — more
                    than the
                    weight of the entirehuman population (which reaches a few hundred billion kilograms).To make
                    something as dense
                    as a neutron star, the whole of humanity would need to be crammed into a space thesize of a sugar
                    cube.</del></p>

            <h3 id="6">(Fact no:6)Gamma-ray bursts can release more energy in 10 seconds than our Sun will in its entire life</h3>
            <p><small>
                    Nothing in the Universe rivals the power unleashed during a gamma-ray burst, a brief but incredibly
                    intense flash
                    of high-energy radiation. There are many types of GRB: some are thought to form when a massive star
                    implodes;
                    others when two neutron stars merge together.</small></p>
                    <hr>
            <h3 id="7">(Fact no:7)There are stars we will never be able to see</h3>
            <p><sup> Ever since the Big Bang, most objects in space have been moving away from one another. In fact, the
                    expansion of
                    the Universe is actually accelerating. As regions of space are whizzing away from one another at an
                    ever-increasing rate, the first population of stars to form in the Universe are now too far away for
                    us to ever
                    hope of spying them – even using the best present or future telescope. Hope is not lost; we can
                    attempt to spot
                    them indirectly via the energetic bursts of radiation they emit at the end of their lives.</sup></p>
                    <hr>
            <h3 id="8">(Fact no:8)Black holes have theoretical opposites known as white holes</h3>
            <p><sub> Black holes are known for their voracious appetites; their influence is so strong that even light
                    can’t escape
                    their gravity. But they have a theoretical converse – white holes.They are effectively the opposite
                    of their
                    dark relatives, spitting out light and matter instead of trapping it.So far, they are purely
                    hypothetical
                    objects; astronomers are contemplating how they could form in reality.</sub></p>
                    <hr>
            <h3 id="9">(Fact no:9)If Jupiter’s magnetic field were visible, it would appear bigger than the Moon</h3>
            <p><strong>The region of space in which a mass’s magnetic field dominates is known as its magnetosphere.
                    These regions
                    surround planets, pulsars and even our Galaxy.The planets in our Solar System have magnetospheres
                    that interact
                    with and are shaped by the charged particles in the wind streaming from our Sun.The largest
                    magnetosphere in our
                    Solar System surrounds Jupiter. Jupiter rotates very fast and has a very strong magnetic field, and
                    its
                    magnetosphere is filled with plasma from its volcanically active moon, Io. These features, coupled
                    with the fact
                    that the solar wind is slower and less dense at Jupiter than at Earth, lead to a very sizeable
                    Jovian
                    magnetosphere. It is easily big enough to contain a body the size of our Sun and, if visible, would
                    be larger
                    than the Moon in our night sky; quite an achievement considering that it is over 1,500 times farther
                    away.</strong></p>

            <h3 id="10">(Fact no:10)Neptune has only completed one orbit around the Sun since its discovery</h3>
            <p><q>Neptune takes a whopping 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since it was discovered
                    in 1846,
                    Neptune only recently finished its first full post-discovery orbit in 2011. Demoted planet Pluto has
                    yet to
                    match this – it is not even close to completing one full, 248-year orbit since its discovery in
                    1930.</p>

            <h3 id="11">(Fact no:11)Planets can wander through space without a parent star</q></h3>
            <p>
            <pre>Not all planets form and stay around stars: astronomers estimate that there could be more than 200 billion of
            them floating free and drifting through our Galaxy.These ‘rogue’ planets were thought to have been kicked out of
            their home systems. While this is true for some, other planets may have formed completely independently of an
            accretion disk (as was the case for our Solar System) instead forming from the collapse of tiny, cold clouds
            known as globulettes.</pre></p>

    <h3 id="12">(Fact no:12)The Sun loses a billion kilos per second</h3>
    <p><em>Particles in the Sun’s upper atmosphere are so hot and energetic that they speed out into space as part of
            the
            solar wind. Our star sheds around 1.3 trillion trillion trillion particles every second. This equates to
            roughly
            one billion kilograms of matter per second, or one Earth every 185 million years.</em></p>
            <hr>
    <h3 id="13">(Fact no:13)Most Sun-like stars in our galaxy are in multiple star systems</h3>
    <p><bdo dir="rtl">Our Sun may be a single star, but it is in the minority.Over half of the Sun-like stars in the
            Milky Way are part
            of multiple star systems, binaries or triplets, with stars orbiting around a common centre of mass. Most
            lower-mass stars like red dwarfs, however, live alone without a companion.</bdo></p>

    <h3 id="14">(Fact no:14)Vast amounts of water have been found in space</h3>
    <p><bdo dir="ltr">Earth’s oceans may not be that unique. Three of Jupiter’s moons (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto)
            and two of
            Saturn’s (Enceladus (pictured above) and Titan) are thought to have underwater seas. Europa’s ocean may
            contain
            over twice the volume of water found on Earth. However, the most water ever discovered surrounds a black
            hole
            some 12 billion lightyears away. This region contains vast amounts of water vapour, the equivalent of 140
            trillion times the volume of water in Earth’s oceans.</bdo></p>

    <h3 id="15">(Fact no:15)There is gravity on the ISS</h3>
    <p><tt> Footage of astronauts on the ISS may give the impression of a gravity-free environment, but onboard gravity
            is
            actually only 10-11% weaker than it is on Earth’s surface.Astronauts float freely due to the ISS’s continual
            state of free-fall, the same effect experienced by skydivers. The difference with the ISS is that it also
            has
            horizontal motion. As the ISS moves ‘sideways’ and falls towards Earth, the horizon curves away beneath it
            at
            the same rate, keeping the ISS in orbit and simulating a feeling of weightlessness for anyone on board.</tt></p>

    <h3 id="16">(Fact no:16)Our days are getting longer</h3>
    <p>
        <center>Earth’s spin speed is slowing: every year, it takes our planet a little longer to complete one full
            revolution on
            its axis. The change is miniscule, however. Every century, Earth slows by 1/500th of a second; 1,000 years
            from
            now, one day will be two hundredths of a second longer than today.</center></p>
            <hr>
    <h3 id="17">(Fact no:17)The Moon is getting farther away every year</h3>
    <p><big>The Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing our planet to be slightly egg-shaped. It affects water even more,
            creating tides and causing the oceans to pile up towards one side of the planet, forming a ‘tidal
            bulge’.This
            bulge is dragged around with the Moon as it orbits. As Earth rotates faster than the Moon – 24 hours versus
            27.3
            days – the bulge moves slightly ahead of the Moon’s position in orbit.The Moon pulls back on it, effectively
            trying to slow it down and causing Earth’s rotation rate to gradually slow down over time as a result.As the
            two
            bodies interact through gravity, this tugging causes Earth to lose energy while the Moon gains
            energy.Because of
            this energy boost the Moon is slowly spiralling outwards, moving away from us by 3.8cm per year.</big></p>

    <h3 id="18">(Fact no:18)Heat from the Big Bang is still around today</h3>
    <p><q>The early Universe consisted of a hot soup of ionised gas: a sort of opaque plasma. About 380,000 years after
            the
            Big Bang, this gas cooled sufficiently enough that atoms were able to form. Radiation left over from the Big
            Bang is still around us today, and is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It can't be seen with
            the
            naked eye, but various missions over the years have been able to study it in microwave light, including
            ESA's
            Planck satellite and the WMAP mission.</q></p>

    <h3 id="19">(Fact no:19)Venus spins backwards</h3>
    <p><strong>Venus spins in the opposite direction to the rest of the planets in our Solar System.Clearly, this is a
            puzzle
            that requires solving if we are to understand more about the formation and evolution of our Solar
            System.Could
            it be that, in the early days of the Solar System, Venus was hit by another object, sending it spinning in
            the
            opposite direction? The truth is, there is no confirmed theory as to why Venus spins backwards relative to
            the
            other planets. But that's not the only strange thing about Venus's orbit. The planet also rotates slowly,
            with
            the Venusian day equivalent to 243 Earth days, and longer than the Venusian year of 225 Earth days.</strong></p>
